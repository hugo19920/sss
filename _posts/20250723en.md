> Iâ€™ve recently updated my resume and would like to share it here in case it might be helpful or of interest to professors, colleagues, or friends.

As a graduate student in mathematics, I have a strong passion for analysis-related fields, especially real analysis, complex analysis, and functional analysis. I'm also expanding my knowledge in areas like algebra, geometry, topology, mathematical statistics, and optimization. During my time as a teaching assistant, Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience explaining mathematical concepts in English and helping students solve problems effectively.

My resume provides an overview of my academic background, coursework, research interests, and teaching experience. If you have any feedback or would like to connect, feel free to reach out.
